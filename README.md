- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vasallo94
- ğŸ‘€ Physicist and astronomer by training, data analysis student by passion. I'm fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and love to explore them through data. When I'm not crunching numbers, I'm indulging my creative side as a poet and photographer. Catch me gazing at the stars or lost in thought behind the camera lens.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis and Data Science.
